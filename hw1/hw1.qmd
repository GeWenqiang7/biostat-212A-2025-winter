## Filling gaps in lecture notes (10% pts)

Consider the regression model $$
Y = f(X) + \epsilon,
$$ where $\operatorname{E}(\epsilon) = 0$.

### Optimal regression function

Show that the choice $$
f_{\text{opt}}(X) = \operatorname{E}(Y | X)
$$ minimizes the mean squared prediction error $$
\operatorname{E}\{[Y - f(X)]^2\},
$$ where the expectations averages over variations in both $X$ and $Y$. (Hint: condition on $X$.)

### Bias-variance trade-off

Given an estimate $\hat f$ of $f$, show that the test error at a $x_0$ can be decomposed as $$
\operatorname{E}\{[y_0 - \hat f(x_0)]^2\} = \underbrace{\operatorname{Var}(\hat f(x_0)) + [\operatorname{Bias}(\hat f(x_0))]^2}_{\text{MSE of } \hat f(x_0) \text{ for estimating } f(x_0)} + \underbrace{\operatorname{Var}(\epsilon)}_{\text{irreducible}},
$$ where the expectation averages over the variability in $y_0$ and $\hat f$.

\(a\) Classification application:

Spam email detection: Response: Email is spam (1) or not (0). Predictors: Frequency of certain keywords, length of the email, etc. Goal: Prediction. The model is used to predict whether new emails are spam or not.

Medical Diagnosis: Response: Whether a patient has a disease Yes (1) or not (0).

Predictors: Age, gender, symptoms, test results, and medical history. Goal: Inference and prediction. Inference is used to understand which predictors are most associated with the disease. Prediction is used to diagnose new patients.

Disease classification: Response variable: the disease classification of the patient, such as diabetes (1) , heart disease (2) , health (0) . Predictive variables: age, blood glucose level, cholesterol level, medical history, lifestyle, etc. Goal: Predict. Assist doctors in making quick diagnostic decisions.

\(b\) Regression application:

Drug dosage and efficacy: Response: Drug efficacy (such as decreased blood glucose levels). Predictive : drug dosage, patient age, weight, etc. Goal: Inference. Assist in drug research, analyze the relationship between dosage and efficacy.

Real estate rent forecast:Response : Rent price. Predictive : geographical location, area, decoration level, surrounding facilities, etc. Goal: Predict. Provide reference prices for the rental market.

Stock market analysis:Response: Future stock price or return. Predictive : historical prices, trading volume, economic indicators, and news sentiment. Goal: Predict. This model helps predict stock prices for investment decisions.

\(c\) Cluster application:

Grouping students based on their academic performance and learning behavior. Features: classroom performance, exam scores, participation, completion of assignments, etc. Goal: To assist teachers in developing teaching plans for different groups. Genotyping analysis

Grouping genes based on DNA sequence data. Features: gene expression level, sequence similarity, etc. Goal: To discover different types of genomic populations for disease research. Retail store location selection

Grouping urban areas based on population density and consumption behavior. Features: Population characteristics (age, income), traffic flow, consumption level, etc. Goal: Help retailers choose the best location.

\(a\) Done!

\
(b)There are 506 rows and 13 columns. Rows represent suburbs or towns in the Boston area. Each column represents a predictor (feature) or response variable (e.g., crime rate, tax rate, median value of homes).

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

(a)-(b)

![](images/17356e791ba29f6f2b80e5588c3b407.jpg)

\(c\) True. The coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction term is very small, suggesting that the interaction effect is minimal. The contribution of $\hatβ X​4$ =0.01⋅640=6.4, which is relatively small compared to other terms.

## Bonus question (20% pts)

For multiple linear regression, show that $R^2$ is equal to the correlation between the response vector $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)^T$ and the fitted values $\hat{\mathbf{y}} = (\hat y_1, \ldots, \hat y_n)^T$. That is $$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}} = [\operatorname{Cor}(\mathbf{y}, \hat{\mathbf{y}})]^2.
$$
